Focused patch that stabilizes Android purchases and aligns the bridge with OpenIAP.

## Fixed

- Prevent freeze on second purchase attempt by guarding concurrent BillingClient initialization (single-flight). Return a structured error from `finishTransaction` when init fails instead of throwing into JS.

## Changed

- Migrate Android native bridge to `openiap-google` and normalize error mapping to `OpenIapError` codes.
- Restore/populate Android-specific fields on `NitroProduct` and `NitroPurchase` (e.g., `originalPriceAndroid`, `introductoryPrice*Android`, `subscriptionPeriodAndroid`, `freeTrialPeriodAndroid`, and numeric `purchaseStateAndroid`).

## Added

- Cross-platform helpers: `getStorefront()` and `deepLinkToSubscriptions()` to match Expo IAP ergonomics.
