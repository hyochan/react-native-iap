Small polish release focusing on examples, documentation, and a critical fix for an iOS crash on startup.

## Added

- Examples: “Manage Subscriptions” buttons in SubscriptionFlow and AvailablePurchases (opens native subscription management cross‑platform)
- Examples: Tap a purchased item to open a details modal

## Changed

- Docs: Clarify event‑driven purchase model (requests don’t resolve with results); add FAQ about transient iOS success→error timing and simple debounce guidance
- Docs/Examples: Prefer `purchase.id`; continue using `purchaseToken` for server validation
- Examples: Redact sensitive fields in logs and modals (no raw `transactionReceipt` or full `purchaseToken`)

## Fixed

- iOS: Sanitize purchase error payload so product identifiers don’t appear in `purchaseToken` on error events; keep internal de‑duplication by SKU
- Examples/Tests: Align transaction row with `purchase.id` and update tests

No breaking changes. Compatible with 14.3.x line.
