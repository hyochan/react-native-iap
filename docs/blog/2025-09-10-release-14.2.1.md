Small stability update focused on iOS and example UX.

## Highlights

- iOS: Upgraded OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.9` ([notes](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-apple/releases/tag/1.1.9))
- iOS: Event‑only purchase flow with error de‑duplication (no double cancel popups)
- Examples: Guard `finishTransaction` until connected; short delayed retry for reliability

## Notes

No breaking changes. If you edited specs, regenerate Nitrogen:

```bash
yarn nitrogen
```
