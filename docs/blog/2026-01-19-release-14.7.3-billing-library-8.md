# React Native IAP 14.7.3

14.7.3 syncs with [OpenIAP v1.3.14](https://www.openiap.dev/docs/updates/notes#1314) bringing Google Play Billing Library 8.0+ features and iOS WWDC 2025 enhancements.

## New Features

### Product Status (Android 8.0+)

Products now include a `productStatusAndroid` field indicating fetch results:

```typescript
const products = await fetchProducts(['com.example.premium']);

products.forEach(product => {
  switch (product.productStatusAndroid) {
    case 'ok':
      // Product fetched successfully
      break;
    case 'not-found':
      // SKU doesn't exist in Play Console
      break;
    case 'no-offers-available':
      // User not eligible for any offers
      break;
  }
});
```

Prior to Billing Library 8.0, products that couldn't be fetched were simply omitted. Now you can understand why a product wasn't available.

### Suspended Subscriptions (Android 8.1+)

New `includeSuspended` option in `getAvailablePurchases`:

```typescript
// Include suspended subscriptions in results
const purchases = await getAvailablePurchases({
  android: {
    includeSuspended: true,
  },
});

purchases.forEach(purchase => {
  if (purchase.isSuspendedAndroid) {
    // Subscription is suspended due to payment issues
    // DO NOT grant entitlements
    // Direct user to subscription management
  }
});
```

Suspended subscriptions have `isSuspendedAndroid: true` and should NOT be granted entitlements. Users should be directed to the subscription center to resolve payment issues.

### Win-Back Offers (iOS 18+)

New support for win-back offers to re-engage churned subscribers:

```typescript
import { requestSubscription } from 'react-native-iap';

await requestSubscription({
  ios: {
    sku: 'com.example.premium_monthly',
    winBackOffer: {
      offerId: 'win_back_50_percent',
    },
  },
});
```

### JWS Promotional Offers (iOS 15+, WWDC 2025)

New simplified JWS format for promotional offers, back-deployed to iOS 15:

```typescript
await requestSubscription({
  ios: {
    sku: 'com.example.premium_monthly',
    promotionalOfferJWS: {
      jws: 'eyJ...your-server-signed-jws...',
      offerId: 'promo_summer_2025',
    },
  },
});
```

### Introductory Offer Eligibility Override (iOS 15+)

Override system-determined eligibility for introductory offers:

```typescript
await requestSubscription({
  ios: {
    sku: 'com.example.premium_monthly',
    introductoryOfferEligibility: true, // Force eligibility
  },
});
```

### Sub-Response Codes (Android 8.0+)

More granular error information via `SubResponseCodeAndroid`:

- `payment-declined-due-to-insufficient-funds` - Payment method has insufficient funds
- `user-ineligible` - User not eligible for the offer
- `no-applicable-sub-response-code` - No additional context available

## Type Updates

- `SubscriptionOfferTypeIOS` now includes `'win-back'` variant
- `RequestPurchaseIosProps.withOffer` clarified: only applies to subscriptions
- `BillingResultAndroid` now includes optional `subResponseCode`
