# React Native IAP

:::warning This repository has moved

**react-native-iap** now lives in the **[OpenIAP monorepo](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap)** — the source is at **[libraries/react-native-iap](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/libraries/react-native-iap)** and the npm package name is unchanged. Please report issues and feature requests at [hyodotdev/openiap/issues](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/issues).

**React Native IAP** is a powerful in-app purchase solution for Expo and React Native applications that **conforms to the [Open IAP specification](https://openiap.dev)**. It provides a unified API for handling in-app purchases across iOS and Android platforms with comprehensive error handling and modern TypeScript support.

If you're shipping an app with react-native-iap, we’d love to hear about it—please share your product and feedback in [Who’s using React Native IAP?](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/discussions/1343). Community stories help us keep improving the ecosystem.

## Sponsors & Community Support

We're building the OpenIAP ecosystem—defining the spec at [openiap.dev](https://www.openiap.dev), maintaining [openiap](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap) for the shared type system, and shipping native SDKs such as [openiap Apple](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/packages/apple) and [openiap Google](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/packages/google). These modules power [react-native-iap](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/libraries/react-native-iap), [expo-iap](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/libraries/expo-iap), [flutter_inapp_purchase](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/libraries/flutter_inapp_purchase), and [kmp-iap](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap/tree/main/libraries/kmp-iap). After simplifying fragmented APIs, the next milestone is a streamlined purchase flow: `initConnection → fetchProducts → requestPurchase → (server receipt validation) → finishTransaction`.

Your sponsorship keeps this work moving—ensuring more developers across platforms, OS, and frameworks can implement IAPs without headaches while we expand to additional plugins and payment systems. Sponsors receive shout-outs in each release and, depending on tier, can request tailored support. If you’re interested—or have rollout feedback to share—you can view sponsorship options at [openiap.dev/sponsors](https://www.openiap.dev/sponsors).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install the package using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install react-native-iap react-native-nitro-modules
```

:::tip Nitro Modules Dependency
Starting from v14.4.0, react-native-iap uses [Nitro Modules](https://github.com/margelo/nitro) for native bridging. For more details, see the [announcement discussion](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/discussions/2985).
:::

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import {useIAP, ErrorCode} from 'react-native-iap';

const {connected, products, fetchProducts, requestPurchase, finishTransaction} =
  useIAP({
    onPurchaseSuccess: async (purchase) => {
      // Validate on your server, then finish
      await finishTransaction({purchase, isConsumable: true});
    },
    onPurchaseError: (error) => {
      if (error.code !== ErrorCode.UserCancelled) {
        console.error('Purchase error:', error.message);
      }
    },
  });

// Fetch products when connected
useEffect(() => {
  if (connected) {
    fetchProducts({skus: ['product_id'], type: 'in-app'});
  }
}, [connected]);

// Purchase (platform-specific)
await requestPurchase({
  request: {
    apple: {sku: 'product_id'},
    google: {skus: ['product_id']},
  },
  type: 'in-app',
});
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

React Native IAP is built with a modern architecture that emphasizes:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all APIs
- **Error Resilience**: Centralized error handling with meaningful error codes
- **Platform Abstraction**: Unified API that handles platform differences internally
- **Performance**: Optimized for minimal bundle size and runtime performance

## 📱 Platform Support

| Platform          | Support | Notes                                        |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| iOS               | ✅      | StoreKit 1 & 2 (StoreKit 2 requires iOS 15+) |
| Android           | ✅      | Google Play Billing v5+                      |
| Expo Go           | ⚠️      | Limited (requires custom development client) |
| Expo Dev Client   | ✅      | Full support                                 |
| Bare React Native | ✅      | Full support                                 |
