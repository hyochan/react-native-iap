Prevents false-positive connected states under rapid navigation.\\n- iOS: Upgraded OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.8` for StoreKit 2 stability.\\n- Android: Ship consumer R8 keep rules so Nitro `HybridObjects` aren\u2019t stripped in release builds. Apps no longer need manual keeps.\\n- CI: Use vendored Yarn binary to avoid Corepack network/503 issues.\\n- Examples: Stabilized Subscription/Purchase flows and improved tests.\\n\\n## Details\\n\\n- `ios/HybridRnIap.swift`: `initConnection()` now awaits OpenIAP initialization and returns the actual result. Errors surface through the purchase error channel with `E_INIT_CONNECTION` and the hook no longer marks as connected prematurely.\\n- `NitroIap.podspec`: Depends on `openiap` `~> 1.1.8`.\\n- `android/consumer-rules.pro`: Keep rules for Nitro IAP classes; wired via `consumerProguardFiles` so downstream apps inherit them automatically.\\n- CI workflows updated to call `.yarn/releases/yarn-3.6.1.cjs` directly.\\n\\n## Upgrade Notes\\n\\nNo breaking API changes. After upgrading:\\n\\n1. Reinstall Pods for the iOS example/app\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   cd example/ios && pod install\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Regenerate Nitrogen if you edited specs\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn nitrogen\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Android consumers can remove any app-local keep rules previously added for Nitro IAP (the library now ships consumer rules)."},{"id":"/2025/09/10/release-14.2.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/2025/09/10/release-14.2.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/tree/main/docs/blog/2025-09-10-release-14.2.1.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-10-release-14.2.1.md","title":"Release 14.2.2","description":"Small stability update focused on iOS and example UX.","date":"2025-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Release","permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/tags/release","description":"New version releases and updates"},{"inline":false,"label":"iOS","permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/tags/ios","description":"iOS platform specific features"},{"inline":true,"label":"nitro","permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/tags/nitro"}],"readingTime":0.3,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hyo","title":"React Native IAP Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/hyochan","page":{"permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/authors/hyochan"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/hyochan","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyochanjang/","x":"https://x.com/hyodotdev"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hyochan.png","key":"hyochan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 14.2.2","authors":["hyochan"],"tags":["release","ios","nitro"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 14.2.0","permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/2025/09/10/release-14.2.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 14.1.1","permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/release-14.1.1"}},"content":"Small stability update focused on iOS and example UX.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- iOS: Upgraded OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.9` ([notes](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-apple/releases/tag/1.1.9))\\n- iOS: Event\u2011only purchase flow with error de\u2011duplication (no double cancel popups)\\n- Examples: Guard `finishTransaction` until connected; short delayed retry for reliability\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nNo breaking changes.

Please review the migration guide carefully.**\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Breaking Changes\\n\\n### 1. Platform-Specific Field Naming\\n\\nAll platform-specific fields now have platform suffixes for clarity.\\n\\n### 2. API Method Changes\\n\\n- `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` return type changed from `Promise<boolean>` to `Promise<NitroPurchase[]>`\\n- `validateReceipt()` method signature has been updated\\n\\n### 3. Type System Updates\\n\\nSeveral type definitions have been restructured for better type safety.\\n\\n## What\'s New in v14.1.0\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfaf Enhanced Type System\\n\\n#### Platform-Specific Field Naming Convention\\n\\nAll platform-specific fields now follow a consistent naming pattern with platform suffixes:\\n\\n**iOS fields now end with `IOS`:**\\n\\n- `isFamilyShareable` \u2192 `isFamilyShareableIOS`\\n- `jsonRepresentation` \u2192 `jsonRepresentationIOS`\\n- New: `typeIOS` for detailed iOS product types\\n\\n**Android fields now end with `Android`:**\\n\\n- `originalPrice` \u2192 `originalPriceAndroid`\\n- `introductoryPriceValue` \u2192 `introductoryPriceValueAndroid`\\n- `subscriptionPeriod` \u2192 `subscriptionPeriodAndroid`\\n\\nThis change makes it immediately clear which fields are platform-specific, improving code maintainability and reducing confusion.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Common Purchase Fields\\n\\nAdded new common fields to the `PurchaseCommon` type for better cross-platform consistency:\\n\\n- `quantity: number` - Purchase quantity (defaults to 1)\\n- `purchaseState: PurchaseState` - Unified purchase state across platforms\\n- `isAutoRenewing: boolean` - Auto-renewal status for subscriptions\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcf1 iOS Product Types\\n\\nIntroduced `ProductTypeIOS` enum for more granular iOS product categorization:\\n\\n```typescript\\nenum ProductTypeIOS {\\n  consumable = \'consumable\',\\n  nonConsumable = \'nonConsumable\',\\n  autoRenewableSubscription = \'autoRenewableSubscription\',\\n  nonRenewingSubscription = \'nonRenewingSubscription\',\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Purchase States\\n\\nNew unified `PurchaseState` enum for consistent purchase status handling:\\n\\n```typescript\\nenum PurchaseState {\\n  pending = \'pending\', // Android: waiting for payment confirmation\\n  purchased = \'purchased\', // Both: successfully purchased\\n  failed = \'failed\', // Both: purchase failed/revoked\\n  restored = \'restored\', // iOS only: restored from previous purchase\\n  deferred = \'deferred\', // iOS only: waiting for parental approval\\n  unknown = \'unknown\', // Both: unspecified state\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Platform Notes:**\\n\\n- **iOS**: StoreKit 2 primarily uses `purchased` state for verified transactions. `restored` and `deferred` states are handled through separate flows.\\n- **Android**: Supports `pending` (awaiting payment), `purchased` (completed), and `unknown` (unspecified) states directly from the Play Billing Library.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udccb API Method Updates\\n\\n#### showManageSubscriptionsIOS()\\n\\nThe `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` method now returns updated subscription information:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before: Promise<boolean>\\n// Now: Promise<NitroPurchase[]>\\nconst updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\n```\\n\\nThis allows you to get real-time subscription status updates after users modify their subscriptions.\\n\\n## Migration Guide\\n\\n### Updating Type References\\n\\nIf you\'re accessing platform-specific fields, update your code:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before\\nif (product.isFamilyShareable) {\\n}\\nif (product.originalPrice) {\\n}\\n\\n// After\\nif (product.isFamilyShareableIOS) {\\n}\\nif (product.originalPriceAndroid) {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Using New Purchase States\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {PurchaseState} from \'react-native-iap\';\\n\\nif (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.purchased) {\\n  // Handle successful purchase\\n} else if (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.pending) {\\n  // Handle pending purchase\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Handling showManageSubscriptionsIOS Response\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before\\nconst success = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\nif (success) {\\n  // Refresh subscriptions manually\\n}\\n\\n// After\\nconst updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\n// Use the returned subscription data directly\\nupdatedSubscriptions.forEach((sub) => {\\n  console.log(\'Updated subscription:\', sub.productId, sub.isAutoRenewing);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n### \u2705 Improved Type Safety\\n\\nPlatform-specific fields are now clearly marked, reducing runtime errors from accessing wrong platform fields.\\n\\n### \u2705 Better Developer Experience\\n\\nConsistent naming conventions make the API more predictable and easier to use.\\n\\n### \u2705 Enhanced Cross-Platform Support\\n\\nCommon fields like `purchaseState` and `isAutoRenewing` provide unified interfaces across platforms.\\n\\n### \u2705 More Detailed Information\\n\\nNew enums and return types provide richer information about products and purchases.\\n\\n## Upgrading\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install react-native-iap react-native-nitro-modules\\n```\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nThank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!\\n\\nFor questions or issues, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap)."},{"id":"release-14-1-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/release-14-1-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/tree/main/docs/blog/release-14-1-1.md","source":"@site/blog/release-14-1-1.md","title":"v14.1.1 -
